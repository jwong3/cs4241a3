## Joan Wong | Post Board

Please visit this site: a3-jwong3.herokuapp.com
(1) Create an account and remember the default username for future logins; 
(2) Click (+) icon to add a message to the discussion board
(3) Click on a message to edit or delete that message, and click on the editor to close it

The web application allows the user to create an account, and join a discussion board where he or she can post messages.
This project is a benchmark for further implementations because the database is designed with dependencies to allow other features such as 
(1) the ability for user's to pick whether to make his or her post public (viewable to all other users in the database)
(2) the status of messages on discussion board (whether or not the user has read the message)

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Storing passwords in database as hashes for security 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Implementing the database with dependencies to allow more flexibility and features

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Using error messages to announce to user of login failure and reminders to remember username
- **Design Achievement 2**: Having a side editor to handle changes to the database
- **Design Achievement 3**: Using CSS selectors and events to add "movement" to the page making it more entertaining to the eye
